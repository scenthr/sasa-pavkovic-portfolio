## Data Science Project Portfolio

I am a Data Scientist with the background in Computer Science and Mathematics and Statistics who focuses on solving problems in the E-commerce industry.

Specifically, i use data science and machine learning to solve problems and generate business insights in customer growth and retention using SQL and Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

The data science project portfolio is composed of XX projects covering the full specturm of the data science process.

This portfolio's projects apply machine learning within a data science context to provide value to E-commerce lines of business using statistical inference, regression, classification, clustering and prinicial component analysis.

## Project portfolio

Project portfolio is organized so that there are smaller projects organized into sections based on where they fall in the Data Science process. At the bottom there are also several end-to-end projects where most of the steps are involved to solve a particular business problem.

##### 1. Import - Getting the data from the original resource

  - <a href="https://github.com/scenthr/sasa-pavkovic-portfolio/blob/master/panda-import-structured-data/pandas-import-structured-data.ipynb" target="_blank">Using pandas to import data</a>

##### 2. Store - Store the data into a data store
  - [Storing imported data into a RDBMs]()

##### 3. Extract - Get the data from the data store
  - [Aggregating and extracting data from RDBMS]()

##### 4. Organize - Organize the data into usable subsets

##### 5. Tidy - Clean the data
  - [Checking the data by inspecting feature values]()

##### 6. Transform - Change the data into something your program will understand
  - [Encoding the categorical features]()
  - [Scaling and normalizing the features]()
  - [Using data pipelines for data transformation]()

##### 7. Visualize - Descriptive statistics exploration
  - [Looking at some feature relationships]()

##### 8. Model - Stats + Machine Learning + Expriment designed
