## Data Science Project Portfolio

I am a Data Scientist with the background in Computer Science and Mathematics and Statistics who focuses on solving problems in the E-commerce industry.

Specifically, i use data science and machine learning to solve problems and generate business insights in customer growth and retention using SQL and Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

The data science project portfolio is composed of XX projects covering the full specturm of the data science process.

This portfolio's projects apply machine learning within a data science context to provide value to E-commerce lines of business using statistical inference, regression, classification, clustering and prinicial component analysis.
