# Kaggle - Predict future sales repo

We are attempting here to create a great solution for the Kaggle competiion called - Predict Future Sales

## Getting Started

Best is to clone this repo and start testing different approaches that we might come up with

### Prerequisites

#### Kaggle

The related competition is on Kaggle under: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales

#### Algorithm libraries

One of the algorithms used was XGB, which needs to be installed on a local computer in a special way.
I had sucessfull instalations on both Win10 and Ubuntu, hence a good support for the installaion exists.
More information: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html

Other libraries that are need can be installed through conda/pip.

### Dataset

Original dataset can be found in the related Kaggle competition. 

##### Data preprocessing

Quite some data processing has been done and final dataset that is used in different algorithms can be shared over Dropbox
if you would like to have it (cca. 450MB in total). I would still suggest here to try to run the code in the python script
mentioned below in odrder to get an idea what was done and where the potential for improvement might be.

Btw. GitHub does not allow uploads of files larger than 100MB.

### Code files

File that containes all the python code used so far is named: PredictFutureSales.py

There are other supporting files and some EDA analysis overviews.

Feel free to change any of the files in the repo!

## Versioning

Lets use Git/GitHub to update the libraries.

## Editing this README.md

Feel free to edit the readme file as well if you feel some information is missing or wrong.
