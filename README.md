## Data Science Project Portfolio

I am a Data Scientist with the background in Computer Science and Mathematics and Statistics who focuses on solving problems in the E-commerce industry.

Specifically, i use data science and machine learning to solve problems and generate business insights in customer growth and retention using SQL and Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

The data science project portfolio is composed of 18 projects and articles covering the full specturm of the data science process.

This portfolio's projects apply machine learning within a data science context to provide value to E-commerce using statistical inference, regression, classification, clustering and prinicipal component analysis.

## Project portfolio

Project portfolio is organized so that there are smaller projects organized into sections based on where they fall in the Data Science process. At the bottom there are also several end-to-end projects where most of the steps are involved to solve a particular business problem.
